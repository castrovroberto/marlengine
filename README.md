# Marlengine üßú‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

## In Loving Memory

Marlengine is a personal game engine project, born from a journey of learning and as a heartfelt tribute to my mother. This project began as a way to explore game engine development, following along with [The Cherno's series](https://youtu.be/JxIZbV_XjAs?si=23SZOyihA8f2OLz5_), and became a source of focus and creativity during a difficult time.

The name "Marlengine" and the mermaid theme are a nod to her memory and the sense of wonder I wish to capture with this engine.

## About The Project

This project is currently a work-in-progress, exploring the intricacies of game engine architecture. 

_(More details about features, goals, and how to get started will be added as the project evolves.)_
